# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
  
  
  
  #Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#Examples

#Weather.create :city => "Southampton", :date => "05032016", :time => "09:50am", :temperature => "60 Deg", :description => "cloudy", :windspeed => "88%"
#Weather.create(city: "Southampton", date: 05032016, time: "09:50am", temperature: "60 Deg.", description: "cloudy", windspeed: "88%")
